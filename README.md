# Stack

## What is Stack?
- A notecard app designed for computer science majors, featuring organized card decks and support for syntax-highlighted, code-friendly notes.

## Why did I build Stack?
- I built this project to reduce the hassle of dealing with poorly formatted study cards. Traditional flashcard tools often make it inconvenient to include code or organize technical notes properly, which wastes time and disrupts studying. This app focuses on convenience and readability, giving computer science students a smoother way to create well-formatted, code-friendly notecards without extra effort.

## What problem does Stack solve?
Computer science students often struggle with existing flashcard or note-taking apps that arenâ€™t designed for technical content. Code snippets end up poorly formatted, hard to read, or stripped of indentation, making them frustrating to review. On top of that, organizing cards by topic or course can be clunky and time-consuming. This app solves those problems by providing syntax-highlighted, code-friendly notecards with easy organization, so students can focus on learning instead of fighting with their tools.
